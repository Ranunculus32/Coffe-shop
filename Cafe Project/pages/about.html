        <h1> Story</h1>
        <p> This caf&eacute; is the dream made possible by Christine Schale. <br>
            As a child she enjoyed serving tea, coffee, cakes and biscuits to house guests. <br>
            She loved playing with her dolls and play pretend that she is in the shop preparing snacks and meals. <br>
            As an adult she develop the love for growing plants. <br>
            She have an impressive indoor plants collection and a sustainable kitchen garden during summer months. <br>
            She started developing her garden and it became her happy place. <br>
            But life has different plans. She moved to the city to study programming and lost in touch with nature <br>
            as urban life offers so many entertainments, attractions and even distractions. However, she has never  <br>
            forgotten her garden. In her busy urban life she longed for some peace and quiet to put her mind at ease. <br> 
            That is when she decided to make her childhood dream come true. She quit her techie job and started a business. <br>
            Instead of making websites and apps, she is now making cakes and brewing coffee sorrounded with her beloved indoor <br>
            plants collection. Under the majestic leaves of Strelitzia she is brewing coffee to her guests. <br>
            She is serving cakes and biscuits sorrounded with Monstera and Peace Lilies. <br>
